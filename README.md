# Planned-Projects
This is just gonna be a list of ideas of projects I want to do

## Machine Learning
- I would like to set up and run the classic machine learning project of recognizing hand drawn numbers [Youtube](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bte8Er0QhDg>)

## More game mods
- Update terraria mod or create a new one

## Find another machine learning project

## Design a game
- Project in progress over the summer

## Update discord bot to use openAI library
- This would be taking the current bot I have and just updating it with openAI

## Create a first game
- This would either be something that has been done before or the concept is simple. As a first game it should be easy and simple and nothing complex.
